jerseywhatnot
=============

there are two ways of running this app now:

1. gradle run to start it from the main method.

and then go to localhost:8080/myapp/*

2. gradle tomcatRun to deploy it to a servlet container.

and then go to lcoalhost:8080/jerseywhatnot/myapp/*

note:

have not figured out how to deploy to a servlet 3.0 container without web.xml yet.
